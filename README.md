# OpenRGB Minecraft Mod
This is a mod for controlling OpenRGB devices through Minecraft using the Fabric API and Mixins as well as https://gitlab.com/mguimard/openrgb-client by morg.
It is currently under development and as of now, only a proof-of-concept.
Help is welcome, particularly creating effects for events.
An option to specify one or more controllers in a file is planned, you have to set them manually currently.

If anyone from the OpenRGB team sees this, it would be great if we could control the effects plugin and other plugins through the SDK too.
