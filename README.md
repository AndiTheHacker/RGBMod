# OpenRGB Minecraft Mod
This is a mod for controlling OpenRGB devices through Minecraft using the Fabric API and Mixins.
It is currently under development and as of now, only a proof-of-concept.
Help is welcome, particularly creating effects for events.
I also am currently trying to get rid of the threads, because they can be a performance issue.

If anyone from the OpenRGB team sees this, it would be great if we could control the effects plugin and other plugins through the SDK too.
